# Paralllel-Matrix-Read-and-Multiply

This project involved running to processes . Process 1 was responsible for reading a matrix using multi-threading whereas Process 2 was responsible for multiplying 
both the matrices using multi-threading as well. Both processes communicated using pipes. Process 3 was the scheduler and helped both processes run using the round robin scheduling algorithm. Their runtime statistics (such as total turnaround time, waiting time,etc.) and plots are shown as well.
